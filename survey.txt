I have been a GCP user for more than a decade, and I find it super easy to use and very intutive. Having said that most of our customers are using SQL and its various variants for a long time. So getting started with BQ is easy. But the challenge we face are in migrating the SQL code. An easy way to migrate legacy SQL code to BigQueryAI will be appreciated. Also it should be easier to embed models from other providers into the eco-system. This prevents vendor lockin and gives us an easy way to benchmark different model outputs.
